- Verified commit: `40590393aab619ff1a4f6795f6def77bf5cd1f0a`. Active/Archived tab transitions now clear selected
  task IDs and the range anchor; setting the same tab preserves selection. Regression
  observed RED (two failures), then GREEN (four passing selection tests).
- Repaired the existing WorktreeHost test mock's missing pathApi; metadata assertions retained.
- Loop improvement: added orientation/backlog and corrected five-project testing guidance.
- Fresh checks: format, lint, typecheck, build, diff whitespace check passed. Full suite:
  157 files and 1,067 tests passed; touched suites: 15 tests passed.
- Runtime: Playwright Chromium 1208 installed using Ubuntu 24.04 download target after the
  installer rejected Ubuntu 26.04. Browser tests passed; no real Electron long journey,
  six-breakpoint visual review, assistive-technology review or production deployment performed.
- Publication: pending outer runner; no push/deploy performed. Main inspected at b3039e0a.
- Review: all fallback roles covered by three grouped read-only reviewers; independent
  adversarial review found no blocking issue. Next frontier is in BACKLOG.md.
